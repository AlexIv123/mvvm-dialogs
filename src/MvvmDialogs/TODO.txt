* Release as NuGet for .NET4.0 and .NET4.5, and maybe also .NET3.5?
* Redesign demo application to show off all features
* DialogService should hold the registered views using weak references.
* Rename 'DialogServiceBehaviors.IsRegisteredView' to 'DialogServiceBehaviors.ViewModelHandlesDialogs'?
* Read up on http://brianlagunas.com/getting-started-prisms-new-viewmodellocator/ and look at the implementation of the locator and also see if I should use the same SetXXX pattern where the locator and factory are set.
* Make sure dialog view model can set a value of true or false depending on the outcome of the dialog.
